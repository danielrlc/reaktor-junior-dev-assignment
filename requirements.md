# App requirements
- [ ] The app should have 3 web pages, one for each product category: jackets, shirts and accessories.
- [ ] Each product page should list all the products in its category, in a straightforward and explicit listing.
- [ ] Switching between product categories should be fast and simple.
- [ ] Initial app loading doesn't have to be fast.
- [ ] Page loading speed should be fast (after the initial load).
- [ ] Filtering, search and pagination can be added to the UI, but are not mandatory.
- [ ] Show color of each product (optional)

# API limitations to consider
- [ ] No changes can be made to them now, or in the future.
- [ ] Both APIs have an internal cache of about 5 minutes.
- [ ] The API doesn't always work. So API errors must be handled gracefully.

# Todos
- [ ] Add links to solution when submitting application.
- [ ] Complete README.md.
- [ ] Provide a polyfill for the use of fetch.
